<h1 id="games-i-enjoy">Games I Enjoy</h1>
<p>Over the years I have enjoyed many video games. One of the first games I ever played was <em>Super Mario World</em> on a <em>Super Nintendo Enetertainment System</em>. Later flash games like the ones you would find on <em>Cool Math Games</em>, <em>Friv</em>, and a lesser known one <em>Game Gecko</em>. My favorite game franchise is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros."><em>Super Smash Brothers</em></a> created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Sakurai"><em>Masahiro Sakurai</em></a>, it is a celebration of video games over the years mainly Nintendo but branching out over the years to companies like <em>Microsoft</em> and <em>Square Enix</em>, with games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft"><em>Minecraft</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts"><em>Kingdom Hearts</em></a>.</p>
