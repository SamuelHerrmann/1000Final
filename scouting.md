<h1 id="scouting">Scouting</h1>
<p>Ever since 1st grade I have been involved with scouting, sepcifically <em>Cub Scouts</em> and <em>Boy Scouts</em>. I am currently an <em>Eagle Scout</em> the highest rank in scouting. I am also in the <em>Order of the Arrow</em>, an honors group in Scouting. I assisted with Scouting for Food, an orgaization that collects food for those in need. I attened 2 <em>High Adeventure</em> camps, Philmont in New Mexico and Seabase in Florida. Loads of fun, had to hike for a week straight in Philmont, and live on an island in Sea base that was about 15 miles from shore. Loads of fun and pain! But scouting did teach me how to use a map and other basic survival skills so that good.</p>
